        // Will msg.sender be assigned to the Pool contract? Does approval on ETH work similarly to ERC20? Or is there another route? 

        // The issue is there's two separate “accounting” systems to track state
        // 1. Regular people keeping track of ETH balances using balances private mapping
        // 2. Flash loans checks just using overall contract balance

        // Ok think I got it, I could deposit some ETH, then take it out of the 'shared' pot
        // The overall balance of the contract would still be the same but I will have built up a deposited allowance of ETH
        // Then I can withdraw 'my' which would result in me having more Eth than I began with, repeat as necessary

        // Second attempt. I can flashloan out the max amount of ETH then re-deposit it straight back 
        // The overall pool contract balance will be the same but I will have 'claimed' it as a deposit under my address
